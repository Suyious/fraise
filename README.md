## Fraise: User Interface made with React

This project is written in plain React <img height="15" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original.svg" /> using functional components and React Hooks. Additionally, it uses React-Router for creating routes. The styling and simple-animations make use of javascript <img height="15" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" /> and css <img height="15" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" /> .

The component that required quite an effort is the landing page that contains a carousel. The carousel is implemented from scratch with javascript. It can be controlled using button clicks, shift + scrolling (horizontal scroll) or swiping on touch-screen devices.
